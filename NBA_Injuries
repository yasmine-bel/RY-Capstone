#Yearly: Beggining in 2010 the number of injury events has increased until 2012. Since 2012 the incidence of injury events has been decreasing. 
#Monthly: From the start of the regular season in October the number of injury events increases until about February. This is when the All Star Game takes place.
#The number of injuries peak around the month of March and stay high during the month of April. The number of injuries start to decrease as the regular season comes to an end. 

#What type of injuries are occuring?
